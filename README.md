# Oncoprint_plot
OncoPrint is a powerful visualization tool that allows us to represent the mutation landscape of different genes across multiple cancer types. It provides a clear view of the genetic alterations and their frequency, helping to uncover potential patterns and insights into cancer biology.

# ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:
The plot showcases mutation types, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), duplications and deletions.
It illustrates the prevalence of specific mutations across various cancer types, highlighting key genetic drivers.
This visualization aids in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and can inform future research directions.
